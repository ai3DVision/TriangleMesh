classdef TriangleMesh < handle
    %TRIANGLEMESH Class for Triangle Meshes. 
    %   Loads triangle mesh from a given file, can perform basic
    %   operations and automatically stores computed data for later 
    %   usage (if wanted). 
    % 
    %   The fields VERT, TRIV, n and m are always filled, other fields
    %   are empty by default. If fields are accessed via the corresponding
    %   function, it will check if the data already exists and read it
    %   from there or compute it if necessary. 
    %   Precomputed data can be safely removed by setting the field to [].
